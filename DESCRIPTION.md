### Problem Statement

*HVAC systems are prone to efficiency losses due to...*

## Design Requirements and Constraints

### Key Requirements
- Multi-zone monitoring
- Real-time responsiveness
- Affordability
- Wireless communication (Wi-Fi & OTA)
- Interactive web interface

### Design Constraints
- Budget limitations
- Sensor sensitivity and resolution issues
- Environmental simulation challenges
- Timeline limitations

## Engineering Standards

- Arduino C++ framework
- IÂ²C, SPI, WebSocket (RFC 6455)
- Power integrity and grounding principles
- Basic safety fallbacks on timeout/disconnect

## Broader Considerations

- Potential energy savings
- Ethical considerations on data privacy
- Focus on accessibility and inclusivity

## Design Description

### System Overview
- Sensors: TMP102, LPS25HB
- Actuators: 5V Fans and Servo
- ESP32 Wroom-32E microcontroller
- Communication: Wi-Fi + WebSocket
- Dashboard: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Block Diagram
> ![Block Diagram](images/block_diagram.png)

### Firmware and Code

Key Features:
- FreeRTOS-based task separation
- Real-time sensor reading & averaging
- WebSocket message handling
- Fan speed/direction control
- Servo angle update logic

Example Code Block:
```cpp
void sensorTask(void* pvParams) {
  while (true) {
    float t1 = readTemperature(0), t2 = readTemperature(2);
    float p1 = readPressure(1), p2 = readPressure(3);
    float avgT = (t1 + t2) / 2.0;
    float avgP = (p1 + p2) / 2.0;

    // JSON serialization & send logic here...
    vTaskDelay(500 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS);
  }
}
