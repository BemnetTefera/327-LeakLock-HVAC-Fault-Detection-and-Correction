# LeakLock – Smart HVAC Fault Detection & Correction System

**LeakLock** is a low-cost, real-time HVAC monitoring solution that detects air duct leaks and corrects airflow across a three-zone system. Built with an ESP32, distributed sensors, and a web interface, it combines embedded systems, IoT, and sustainable design principles to solve a real-world energy efficiency problem.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Sensors collect pressure and temperature data from three duct zones.
2. ESP32 processes this data and communicates with a web dashboard over Wi-Fi.
3. Based on detected anomalies (e.g., pressure drop), the system adjusts fans and damper positions to maintain balance.
4. The user can monitor and override controls via the web interface.
5. Updates can be deployed remotely via OTA.
